# Introduction
In business, an unicorn is a tech based start-up company valued at over $1 billion USD. Prominent companies include ByteDance, Stripe and Canva. This project aims to let viewers enjoy learning about unicorn companies and their trends through the magazine's storytelling style. The target audience for this visualization is people in business, finance, or those that are interested in unicorn companies in general.
